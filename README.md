# data-analysis-portfolio

Hi, I'm Sarah. I currently work as a Data Analyst specialising in Fraud and Investigations in financial services. This repository is intended to showcase skills and give insight to how I leverage data to uncover patterns, anomolies and insights to drive better decision making. Given the sensitive and confidential nature of the work I do, this portfolio largely includes data analysis relating to my person interests rather than being work related albeit showcases the same skills.
